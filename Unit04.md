**Unit 4: Effective Business Writing** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will explore the written word in a business context,
including the important but contrastingly asynchronous elements which
that communication shares with oral communication.  Successful writing
develops from such good habits as reading, targeted writing practice,
and critical thinking and is characterized by the use of rhetorical and
cognitive strategies.  Accordingly, you will learn to apply appropriate
styles and ethical principles in various business writing contexts while
recognizing the kinds of barriers that can challenge your communication
objectives and outcomes.*

    These readings start with a review of the elements discussed in the
    communication models introduced in subunit 1.2, defining and
    exemplifying each element again to illustrate how writing for the
    eye differs from writing for the ear.  The key concept here is that
    the biggest difference between those writing styles is that writing
    for the eye is usually asynchronous.  At the end of Section 1, try
    to complete the exercises.  
        
     This reading and these exercises should take approximately 1
    hour.
