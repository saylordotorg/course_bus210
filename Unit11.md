    (i.e., words, sounds, or images that compel the audience to pass
    them along) can be used to help a business spread the word about a
    new venture by appealing to an audience’s emotion, using a trigger
    to provoke reaction, and being highly relevant to the audience.

    that prompt you to work or share with a classmate, instead try to
