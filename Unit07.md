    Dream”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tchspyLEHaw&feature=related)
    Speech (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Recall the nine cognate strategies covered in earlier
    chapters: clarity, conciseness, arrangement, credibility,
    expectation (norms and anticipated outcomes), sources and frames of
    reference, tone, emphasis (relevance), and engagement
    (relationship).  Critique Martin Luther King, Jr.’s famous “I Have a
    Dream” speech (approximately 17:30 minutes), focusing your criticism
    on these nine cognate strategies.  Consider that this speech is
    consistently ranked as one of the most effective and persuasive
    speeches in history.  Pay close attention to King’s masterful use of
    metaphor.  Each metaphor creates powerful imagery.  As you identify
    the use of the 9 cognate strategies, also remember the rhetorical
    context.
