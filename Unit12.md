**Unit 12: Negative News and Crisis Communication** <span
id="12"></span> 
*In this unit, you will discover how in times of confusion or crisis,
clear and concise communication takes on an increased level of
importance.  You will encounter effective ways to deliver negative
messages, including the standard process of presenting a buffer or
cushion statement, an explanation, the negative news itself, and then a
redirecting statement, and you will appreciate how eliciting negative
news through feedback is an important way to avoid problems.  Every
organization should have a crisis communication plan, which is why you
will become familiar with the elements of a crisis plan, including how
to manage press conferences.*
