**Unit 14: Intercultural and International Business Communication**
<span id="14"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to communication challenges that
cross cultural and national boundaries.  Because intercultural and
international businesses focus less on the borders that separate people
and more on the communication that brings them together, you need to be
prepared for when your role as a business communicator crosses cultures,
languages, value and legal systems, and borders.  This unit will
describe the convergent and divergent cultural characteristics that
typify the business world and will review the effects of intercultural
communication on management styles and the global marketplace.*
