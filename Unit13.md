**Unit 13: Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Business Communication**
<span id="13"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the self-concept and dimensions of
the self as they characterize your intrapersonal communication (i.e.,
how you communicate with yourself).  In addition, you will examine how
you communicate with other individuals—your interpersonal communication
habits and needs—and how those characteristics can be explained by
social penetration theory and predicted by rituals associated with human
interaction and conversation.  You will also learn how effective
communication can improve how individuals handle disagreements and
misunderstandings.*
