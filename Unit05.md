    (PDF)

      
     Instructions: Review Section 1 in Chapter 9 of *Business
    Communication for Success* and note that when this assessment
    requires you to rewrite the emails, you should use Figure 9.2 as the
    template for the format of your revisions.  Download the PDF linked
    above for further instructions.  This assessment involves using a
    table to critique and rewrite a pair of related emails.  Note that
    it is important for you to critique each element in the table and
    that you recognize that some elements have more than one problem.
     Once you have completed the table, compare your work to The Saylor
    Foundation’s [“Email Assessment
    Answers”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Email-Assessment-Answer-Key.pdf)
    (PDF).  Realize, however, that while your revised emails should
    improve the elements you criticized, there are many ways to do so
    and thus the emails you produce will not be the same as the examples
    provided in the answers.  
      
     You should spend approximately 30 minutes on this assessment.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Review Section 5 in Chapter 9 of *Business
    Communication for Success,* and then produce a résumé based on
    information about a hypothetical the job seeker.  Open the link
    above for detailed instructions and content.  When you have
    completed your version of the job seeker’s résumé, compare your work
    to The Saylor Foundation’s [“Résumé Assessment Answer
    Key”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BUS210-Résumé-Assessment-Answer-Key-Fixed.pdf) (PDF).  
      
     Realize, however, that there can be many options for selecting and
    presenting information in a résumé, so the résumé you produce will
    not be the same as the example.  If you discover significant
    differences between the example and your work, use the following set
    of evaluation questions to critique your version:  

    -   Did you break the content into blocks and lists preceded by
        easy-to-understand, hierarchical headings with similar
        grammatical structures for each heading level?
    -   Did your résumé include consistent content and formatting across
        all heading levels?
    -   Are the details you included prioritized such that the most
        impressive are presented first and the least impressive last (or
        were omitted)?
    -   Did you use bulleted lists, white space, and text treatments
        like boldface and italics to highlight information and ensure
        that the résumé can be reviewed and understood easily?

    You should spend approximately 1 hour on this assessment.

     Instructions: Review Section 6 in Chapter 9 of *Business
    Communication for Success*, paying particular attention to Table
    9.6: The Five Main Parts of a Persuasive Message.  Open the link for
    further instructions.  This assessment involves inserting words,
    phrases and statements into a sales letter to enhance the impact of
    each part of the pitch.  When you have finished filling in the
    blanks, compare your work to The Saylor Foundation’s [“Sales Letter
    Assessment Answer
    Key”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BUS210-Sales-Letter-Assessment-–-Answer-Key-Fixed.pdf) (PDF).
     Realize, however, that there can be many options for selecting and
    presenting information in a sales letter, so the letter you produce
    will not be the same as the example.  However, if upon comparing
    your work with the example, you are not satisfied with what you
    produced, consider replacing the content in the example with
    alternatives that are equally effective.  This additional exercise
    may help you recognize better the range of language that can be
    used.  
      
     This assessment should take approximately 30 minutes.
