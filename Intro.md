Course Syllabus for "BUS210: Corporate Communication"
-----------------------------------------------------

The introduction of *Business Communication for Success*, the textbook
used throughout this course, notes that “[E]ffective communication takes
preparation, practice, and persistence.  There are many ways to learn
communication skills; the school of experience, or ‘hard knocks,’ is one
of them.  But in the business environment, a ‘knock’ (or lesson learned)
may come at the expense of your credibility through a blown presentation
to a client.” Effective communication skills are a prerequisite for
succeeding in business.  Communication tools and activities connect
people within and beyond the organization in order to establish the
business’s place in the corporate community and the social community,
and as a result, that communication needs to be consistent, effective,
and customized for the business to prosper.  *Business Communication for
Success* provides theories and practical information that represent the
heart of this course, while additional resources are included to expand
or pose alternatives to the approaches chosen in the textbook.  You will
receive maximum benefits from this course if you complete the readings
first and then use the additional resources to fill in the blanks and/or
reconsider the topics in the textbook. **This course provides students
the opportunity to earn actual college credit. It has been reviewed and
recommended for 3 credit hours by [The National College Credit
Recommendation Service](http://www.nationalccrs.org/) (NCCRS).  While
credit is not guaranteed at all schools, we have
[partnered](http://www.saylor.org/partner-schools/) with a number of
schools who have expressed their willingness to accept transfer of
credits earned through Saylor. You can read more about our NCCRS program

### Course Information

Welcome to BUS210.  Below, please find general information on the course
and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer: **[Dr. P. Wynn
Norman](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#ProfessorPWynnNorman)  
  
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes considerable use of
the following materials:  

-   [*Business Communication for
    Success*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Business%20Communication%20for%20Success.pdf)
-   Harrisburg Area Community College: Instructor Valery Gray’s
    [“Written Business
    Communication”](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/engl-106-written-business/id424629725)
-   Harrisburg Area Community College: Instructor Laura Davis’
    [“Blended: Effective
    Speaking”](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/spch-101-blended-effective/id424633853)
-   University of Arizona: Professor Randolph Accetta’s [“Presentation
    Skills for New
    Ventures”](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/presentation-skills-for-new/id413137966)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Pay special attention to Unit 5, which covers the written communication
formats most commonly used by businesses.  You will also need to
complete:  

-   Subunit 5.1: “Text, E-mail, and Netiquette” – provides information
    helpful to completing the Email Assignment
-   Subunit 5.2: “Memorandums and Letters” – provides information
    helpful to completing the Memorandum and Business Letter Assignments
-   Subunit 5.5: “Résumés” – provides information helpful to completing
    the Résumé Assignment
-   Subunit 5.6: “Sales Messages” – provides information helpful to
    completing the Sales Letter Assignment
-   Final Exam

**Time Commitment: **This course should take you approximately **119
hours** to complete, including the assignments and Final Exam.  Each
unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of time you are
expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help you plan your time
accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
to determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete
each unit, and then to set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1
should take you approximately 5.25 hours to complete.  Perhaps, you can
complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 2.75 hours) on Monday night;
subunits 1.3 and 1.4 (a total of 2.5 hours) on Tuesday night; etc. 
Ideally, you should study on successive nights when you know you will
not be disturbed by other engagements.   
  
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Writing is an essential business skill because it
not only enables you to communicate effectively, but the quality of your
writing is also seen as a stand-in for the quality of your product or
service: It contributes to your business’ image.  If you are uncertain
about the quality of your writing, you might want to participate in
[OpenStudy](http://openstudy.com/groups/writing), a free study group
website in which individuals voluntarily provide feedback in response to
users’ questions about writing.  [Yahoo
Answers’](http://answers.yahoo.com/) “Homework Help” category, or its
“Marketing & Advertising,” “Small Business” and “Business and Finance”
categories, may also enable you to get feedback on your writing.
