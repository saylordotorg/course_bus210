    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Please watch this entire video (approximately 9
    minutes), in which Dr. Nault and his class discuss the situational
    connectedness of culture, influence, and communication while viewing
    video clips and images that illustrate the nature of those
    interrelationships.  Focus on the content of the discussion and not
    the black and white text from students praising the presenter
    between each segment.  In the first film analyzed, think about the
    differences between Australian and Japanese culture.  In the second
    clip presented, remember that the length and degree a person bows in
    Japanese culture has a correlation to individual status.  The lower
    one person chooses to bow, the more respect he or she has for the
    individual receiving the bow.  In the last clip discussed, consider
    the impact of brevity on the communication and creation of new
    ideas.  Can this influence the way we think?  Consider the role of
    culture, context, and brevity on communication.
