     Instructions: View the brief, 1-minute lecture.  See if you reach
    the same number as the narrator and then reflect on what this
    demonstrates about perception and communication.  Consider this
    video in the context of the perception lectures listed above and
    below.  How can you use your own traits to evaluate factors that
    contribute to self-concept?  For example, if you have the perceived
    trait of patience, does this impact how you view yourself?  How
    might this perceived trait impact your communication with others?
     The “awareness test” is a way to challenge our perceptual traits,
    and allow us to question those traits to gain greater
    self-knowledge.
