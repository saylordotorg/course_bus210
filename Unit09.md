**Unit 9: Presentations to Persuade** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this unit, you will understand the nature and challenges of
persuasion by becoming more familiar with the principles, functions, and
organizational structures associated with persuasive speeches.  By
focusing on your audience’s traits and needs, you will learn how to
present an argument effectively and ethically as well as how to avoid
logical fallacies.  This unit also introduces you to the highly
business-relevant “elevator speech”: a 30-second persuasive pitch that
exemplifies the time-constrained communication challenges often
encountered in business settings.*
